# I have come to realize about Digital Transformation and its implication and have just completed the "IBM I am Vitalized Artificial Intelligence Course Data Science course".
I'm actively self-training myself with different data science projects and with Python. I'm also actively looking for internship, project and pro-bono work.
Through this course, I've gained a lot of hard and soft skills including data transformation and machine learning and the methodical mindset that is needed to get valuable insights. I understand the need for Enterprise Design Thinking and Agile DevSecOps.
I have been a full time tutor for 11 years (CELTA certified), after leaving full time employment of 13 years in product development and field application. I have enabled hundreds of students over a decade plus.
I always strive to be the most engaged and out-of-the-box yet result-orientated person in any situation, hence, I do appreciate you giving me this opportunity of being an Data Engineer in your good company.
